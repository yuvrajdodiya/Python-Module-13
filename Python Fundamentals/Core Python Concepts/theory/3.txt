â€¢ Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise

        operator: specific symbol to perfrom specific opreation.

        arithmetic operators : 
                    + ,- ,* , / , // (floor division) , **(exponention)

        comparison operator(relation operator) :
                    ==
                    !=
                    >

                    >=
                    <= 
        logical operator : 

                and (one condition true and second condition are fales)
                or (both condition are true )
                not (condition is fales)

        bitwise operator: 

            And(&)
            left shift(<<)
            right shift(>>)
            or(|)
            not(~)
