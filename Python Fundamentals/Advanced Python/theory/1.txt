#â€¢ How functional programming works in Python.


            
1. First-Class Functions :- 
    Functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables,
    passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

2. Higher-Order Functions :- 
    Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

3. Immutability :- 
    Functional programming encourages using immutable data structures, 
    which cannot be modified after creation.

4. Lambda Functions :-  
    Anonymous functions created with the lambda keyword for concise function expressions.

5. Map, Filter, and Reduce :- 
    1. map(func, iterable) :-
        Applies a function to all elements in an iterable.

    2. filter(func, iterable) :- 
        Filters elements based on a condition.

    3. reduce(func, iterable) :- 
        Performs a cumulative operation. Requires functools.reduce.
    
6. Recursion :-
    Functions calling themselves instead of using loops.
