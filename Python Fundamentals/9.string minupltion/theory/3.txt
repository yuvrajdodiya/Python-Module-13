â€¢ String slicing
          String slicing allows you to extract a portion (substring) 
          from a string. This operation is powerful and flexible, as it 
          enables you to access specific characters or parts of a string 
          by specifying a range of indices.

       start: The starting index .
       end: The ending index.
       step: The range between index.
