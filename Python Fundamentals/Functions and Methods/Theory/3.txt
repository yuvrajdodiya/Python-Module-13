
â€¢ Scope of variables in Python.

There are 4 types of scope in variable

1. Local Scope :-
    Definition :- 
        A variable declared inside a function is in the local scope. It is accessible only within  that function.

2. Enclosing Scope (Nonlocal) :- 
    Definition :- 
        Variables declared in an enclosing function (a function inside another function) are in the enclosing scope

3. Global Scope :- 
    Definition :- 
        A variable declared outside any function or block is in the global scope. It can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
    
4. Built-in Scope :- 
    Definition :- 
        This is the outermost scope and includes all built-in functions and keywords in Python, like print(), len(), or int().
