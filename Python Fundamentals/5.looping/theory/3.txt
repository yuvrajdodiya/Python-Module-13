â€¢ Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.).
1. List :- 
    A list is an ordered, mutable collection. loops can be used to intrate through each element.

    Example :- 
        number = ['12', '03', '13']
        for I in numbre:
            Print(I)

2. Tuple :- 
    A tuple is similar to a list but immutable. loops work similarly with tuples.

    Example :
        num = (10, 20, 30)
        for I in num:
            Print(I) 
        
3. Set :-
    A set is an unordered collection of unique element.Looping through a set may not preserve order.

    Example :- 
        name = {'yuvraj', 'om', 'smit'}
        For name in  name
            print(name)

4. Dictionaries :-
    A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. You can loop through keys, values, or both.
    Example : - 
         dict = {}
